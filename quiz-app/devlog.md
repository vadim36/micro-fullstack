# Quiz App 
## Core Idea
Creating and sharing quizes between users. Participants and conductors can see the results in the dashboard;
## Dev Stages
1) Project Setup
- Divide the application into layers, different areas of responsibility, according to the FSD's architecture;
- Setup the UI kit - in my case I prefer using shadcn/ui library + setup the settings of installation;
- Setup the storing data - in my case it's a database "sqlite" and SMDB - Prisma;
- Optionally - Add seed scripts to test the database;
